# Face-verification-with-GUI
PyQt GUI for face verification app


Expected Behaviour:
On Startup: The base image ( 1.jpg) appears in the base label.
Load an Image: When the user clicks "Load an image," they can select a new image, which will appear in the chosen label.
Check Faces: When the user clicks "Check," it compares the face in the base image and the chosen image, displaying the result ("The faces match!" or "The faces do not match.") in the message label.
Change Base Image: The user can change the base image via the "New base image" action (top left of the main window).
I have added a status Tips descripe each object on the main window.
